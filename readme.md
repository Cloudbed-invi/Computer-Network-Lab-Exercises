## Experiments Overview

### **Experiment 1: Study of Network Tools**
- **Objective**: 
  - Explore and utilize commonly used network tools for troubleshooting and management.
- **Description**: 
  - Conducted a study of network tools available in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, including:
    - **Ping**: For testing connectivity between devices.
    - **Traceroute**: For identifying the path packets take through the network.
    - **Simulation Mode**: For visualizing and analyzing packet flow between devices.
  - A **peer-to-peer connection** was set up using a switch to demonstrate the use of these tools in real-time scenarios.

### **Experiment 2: Study of Network Devices**
- **Objective**: 
  - Understand the functionality and roles of different network devices.
- **Description**: 
  - Explored the configuration and operation of devices such as:
    - **Switches**
    - **Routers**
    - **PCs and Laptops**
  - Configured a simple **peer-to-peer connection** using Cisco Packet Tracer.
  - Connected **4 PCs and 1 laptop** to a switch to establish communication and validate connectivity.

### **Experiment 4: Network Topologies**
- **Objective**: 
  - Study and implement various network topologies.
- **Description**: 
  - Simulated and analyzed the following topologies in **Cisco Packet Tracer**:
    - **Bus Topology**
    - **Star Topology**
    - **Ring Topology**
    - **Mesh Topology**
    - **Hybrid Topology**
  - Observed data flow in each topology and noted their advantages and limitations.

### **Experiment 5: Creating VLANs**
- **Objective**: 
  - Learn and implement VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Description**: 
  - Configured two VLANs on two managed switches:
    - **VLAN 10**: Named `HR`
    - **VLAN 20**: Named `Accounts`
  - Used the **console** to configure VLANs and assign devices to the respective VLANs.
  - Verified that devices within the same VLAN could communicate, while devices in different VLANs were isolated unless explicitly configured for inter-VLAN communication.

### **Experiment 6: Creating inter VLANs**
- **Objective**: 
  - Learn and implement inter VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Description**: 
  - Configured two VLANs on two managed switches:
    - **VLAN 10**
    - **VLAN 20**
  - Used the **console** to configure VLANs and assign devices to the respective VLANs.
  - Verified that devices within the same VLAN could communicate, and different VLANs can communicate using ping commad in terminal.

  ### **Experiment 7: Creating spannning tree**
- **Objective**: 
  - Learn and implement Spanning tree using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Description**: 
  - Configured three switches:
    - Identify root brige and root port.
  - Check the pkt file to know how to identify it.

    ### **Experiment 8: Configuration and Connecting Wifi using PC and Laptop**
- **Objective**: 
  - Configure and connect different enddevices to wifi service.
- **Description**: 
  - Configure wifi, and physical wifi component.
    - And configure wifi device password.


    ### **Experiment 9: Configuration of DHCP (dynamic ip allocation) for all devices**
- **Objective**: 
  - Configure and connect different enddevices to a router using dynamic ip address.
- **Description**: 
  - Configure router to support dhcp.
  - Allocate DHCP to end devices.
