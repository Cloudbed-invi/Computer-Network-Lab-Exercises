# Networking Experiments

This repository documents a series of hands-on networking experiments designed to enhance understanding of network tools, devices, and configurations. Each experiment is detailed below with its objectives, procedure, and outcomes.

## Experiments Overview

### **Experiment 1: Study of Network Tools**
- **Objective**: 
  - Understand and explore commonly used network tools.
- **Description**: 
  - Conducted a study of various network tools to monitor, troubleshoot, and manage networks. Tools studied include:
    - **Ping**: For testing connectivity between devices.
  - Post-study, a **peer-to-peer connection** was established using a network switch to apply these tools.

### **Experiment 2: Study of Network Devices**
- **Objective**: 
  - Gain practical knowledge of different network devices and their roles.
- **Description**: 
  - Studied the functionality of:
    - **Switches**
    - **Routers**
    - **Hubs**
    - **Network Interface Cards (NICs)**
  - Configured a simple **peer-to-peer connection**.
  - Connected **4 PCs and 1 laptop** to a single switch, enabling communication between devices.

### **Experiment 4: Network Topologies**
- **Objective**: 
  - Understand different network topologies and their implementation.
- **Description**: 
  - Explored and implemented the following topologies:
    - **Bus Topology**
    - **Star Topology**
    - **Ring Topology**
    - **Mesh Topology**
    - **Hybrid Topology**
  - Observed how data flows in each topology and the advantages/disadvantages of each.

### **Experiment 5: Creating VLANs**
- **Objective**: 
  - Learn about VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) and how to configure them on network switches.
- **Description**: 
  - Created two VLANs:
    - **VLAN 10**: Named `HR`
    - **VLAN 20**: Named `Accounts`
  - Configured VLANs using the console of two managed switches.  
  - Ensured devices within the same VLAN could communicate, while devices in different VLANs were isolated unless explicitly allowed.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Network Tools**: Ping, Traceroute, Wireshark, Netstat
- **Devices**: Switches, PCs, Laptops
- **Protocols**: Ethernet
- **Software**: Console for switch configuration
